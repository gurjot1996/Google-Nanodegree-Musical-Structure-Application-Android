# Musical-Structure-Application-Android
4th project of the Google's Android nanodegree program
In this project I have created a structure or the blueprint of a music player .The homepage displays various categories such as all songs,generes,playlists etc.
Clicking on each redirects to that particular activity.
for eg clicking on all songs displays all the songs on the device clicking on a song redirects to now playing activity in which user can play,pause,play next/prev song.
Similarly clicking on generes redirects to generes activity and same for playlists.

Concepts Covered in implementation of this project
1) Setting onClickListener for various TextView,Button,ImageView
2) Learning about implicit/explicit intents
3) Using ScrollView Layout
4) Implemented nested Viewgroups such as RelativeLayout,LinearLayout.
5) Using setImageResouce() method for changing image on user click
6) Switching between various activities with the use of explicit intents
